	These two sets of points are often defined by the measurements of
	two sets of variables for the same individuals (e.g., measurements
	of species abundances and environmental variables at the same sites).
	We present a solution for graphical representation of the results
	of procrustes analysis when the number of variables in each of the
	two datasets exceeds two. This method is named procrustean co-inertia
	analysis because it is based on the joint use of procrustes analysis
	and co-inertia analysis, which is a coupling method for finding linear
	combinations of two sets of variables of maximal covariance. It provides
	better graphical representation of the concordance between the two
	datasets than classical co-inertia analysis. Moreover, distance matrices
	can be introduced in the analysis to improve its ecological meaning.
	Lastly, a randomization test equivalent to PROTEST is proposed as
	an alternative to the Mantel test. An ecological example is presented
	to illustrate the method.},

  abstract = {Spatial structures of ecological communities may originate either
	from the dependence of community structure on environmental variables
	or/and from community-based processes. In order to assess the importance
	of these two sources, spatial relationships must be explicitly introduced
	into statistical models. Recently, a new approach called principal
	coordinates of neighbour matrices (PCNM) has been proposed to create
	spatial predictors that can be easily incorporated into regression
	or canonical analysis models, providing a flexible tool especially
	when contrasted to the family of autoregressive models and trend
	surface analysis, which are of common use in ecological and geographical
	analysis. In this paper, we explore the theory of the PCNM approach
	and demonstrate how it is linked to spatial autocorrelation structure
	functions. The method basically consists of diagonalizing a spatial
	weighting matrix, then extracting the eigenvectors that maximize
	the Moran's index of autocorrelation. These eigenvectors can then
	be used directly as explanatory variables in regression or canonical
	models. We propose improvements and extensions of the original method,
	and illustrate them with examples that will help ecologists choose
	the variant that will better suit their needs.},

  abstract = {Question: Are there spatial structures in the composition of plant
	communities?
	
	
	Methods: Identification and measurement of spatial structures is a
	topic of great interest in plant ecology. Univariate measurements
	of spatial autocorrelation such as Moran's I and Geary's c are widely
	used, but extensions to the multivariate case (i.e. multi-species)
	are rare. Here, we propose a multivariate spatial analysis based
	on Moran's I (MULTISPATI) by introducing a row-sum standardized spatial
	weight matrix in the statistical triplet notation. This analysis,
	which is a generalization of Wartenberg's approach to multivariate
	spatial correlation, would imply a compromise between the relations
	among many variables (multivariate analysis) and their spatial structure
	(autocorrelation). MULTISPATI approach is very flexible and can handle
	various kinds of data (quantitative and/or qualitative data, contingency
	tables). A study is presented to illustrate the method using a spatial
	version of Correspondence Analysis.
	
	
	Location: Territoire d'Etude et d'Expérimentation de Trois-Fontaines
	(eastern France).
	
	
	Results: Ordination of vegetation plots by this spatial analysis is
	quite robust with reference to rare species and highlights spatial
	patterns related to soil properties.},
